## Sketch Tool Release Notes

### 1.2

- Updated to understand Sketch 3.1 documents
- Slight tweaks to the way trimming and sizing works, which may slightly reduce the size of exported documents
- Moved support for old documents into the standalone sketchmigrate tool
- We now look for the resources in ../share/sketchtool/resources.bundle (for legacy reasons, we also still check for "sketch resources.bundle" in the old location)
- Items (pages, artboards, slices etc) with slashes in their names will now correctly export into subfolders.

### 1.1.1

- Added an export layers command which lets you export any layer, even if it's not been marked as exportable in the document.
- Added a --compact option for SVG export which removes some of the extra crud that we would otherwise generate.
- Added a --trimmed option, although it's not respected currently.
- Fixed some bugs relating to the --items option.
- Fixed the app name in generated SVG files.
